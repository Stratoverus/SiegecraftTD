# SiegecraftTD
# Overview

SiegecraftTD is an immersive tower defense game that challenges players to strategically defend their base against waves of diverse enemies. Built using the Godot engine, this project represents my exploration into game development architecture, focusing on creating scalable systems for gameplay mechanics, user progression, and data persistence.

This project serves as a practice for game development. I have been fascinated by how games work, and this has been an incredible opportunity for me to see that and experience how intricate this is. I have been enjoying my time working on this and I look forward to continuing to make this

# Development Environment

I used a mix of vscode and the Godot editor to create this project. I needed to use the Godot extension in vscode to get the error checking on there. 

# Useful Websites

* [Good Game Assets, most are free](https://itch.io/)
* [Godot Forums](https://forum.godotengine.org/)

# Future Work

* Add a research center to add buffs that way
* Fix achievements, as some do not track properly
* Boss rounds need to be better
